# SPYRE
David Wilson

"Spyre" is a programming language that began development in December, 2015.  This is
the sixth (or so) iteration of Spyre.  The previous iterations can be found at:

+ https://github.com/ForeverDev/spyre3
+ https://github.com/ForeverDev/spyre4

Each version of Spyre is increasingly better than the last (as my knowledge about
programming languages has grown).  

Spyre is a statically typed, interpreted programming language.  There are two
data types in Spyre: `int` and `float`.  Both have 64 bit storage.  `int` is
automatically signed (although I may add unsigned support in the future?).
